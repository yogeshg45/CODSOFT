## Dataset Description

The dataset contains restaurant-related information, including:

- **Restaurant Name**
- **Cuisines**
- **City**
- **Locality**
- **Latitude**
- **Longitude**
- **Aggregate Rating**

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Feature Importance with Decision Tree Regressor

- **Objective**: Identify the most influential features impacting restaurant ratings.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load the dataset and identify non-numeric columns.
  2. Perform one-hot encoding for categorical features.
  3. Train a Decision Tree Regressor to predict the `Aggregate rating`.
  4. Calculate feature importance and identify the most influential features.
- **Output**:
  - Feature importance ranking.
  - Performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

### Task 2: Predict Ratings Based on Cuisine Preferences

- **Objective**: Predict restaurant ratings based on user-provided cuisine preferences.
- **Steps**:
  1. Encode cuisine types using `LabelEncoder`.
  2. Train a Decision Tree Regressor with cuisine data.
  3. Predict ratings for specific cuisine preferences.
- **Output**:
  - Predicted rating for user preferences.
  - Model performance metrics: MSE and R².

### Task 3: Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Objective**: Optimize a Logistic Regression model to predict binary outcomes.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate synthetic data with random features and labels.
  2. Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.
  3. Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- **Output**:
  - Best hyperparameters.
  - Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix.

### Task 4: Geographic Visualization of Restaurant Data

- **Objective**: Visualize restaurant distribution and ratings using interactive maps and plots.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a Folium map to visualize restaurant locations.
  2. Display popups with restaurant details.
  3. Analyze and visualize restaurant count and average ratings by city using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Output**:
  - Interactive HTML map (`restaurant_map.html`).
  - Box plot of rating distribution by city.
